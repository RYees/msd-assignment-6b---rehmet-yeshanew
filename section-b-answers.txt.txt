1. => git checkout -b newbranch-name

2. No,it is not a good idea to do all our work on a single branch because if we somewhat make a change that affect one another work it will create a big
   conflict in one branch but if we work on two different branches, the changes we made on our own branch does not affect one another's work since it is 
   on different branch.

3. example 1 => the refs folder - it contains the head folder which has all the braches created so far and each branch contain the hash value of the recent commit 
                                  thier own branch.
   example 2 => the head file - contians the following line : refs/heads/master ==> which indicate the actual location to the reference file


4. - Switch to the fixes brach using the command => git checkout fixes
   - Verify the changes on the fixes branch by => make sure they are tracked files using the command - git add .
                                               => they are committed using the command - git commit -m " "
